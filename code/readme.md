## Processing code

Run the processing script first, this will produce data frames necessary for exploratory analysis as well as modeling code

## Exploratory analysis code

Run this code if you are interested in seeing some simple single variate and multivariate illustrations that will allow you to get familiar with the data. However, it is not necessary to run any of this code for downstream analysis.

## Modeling code

First, run `data_splitting.Rmd` to split the data into training and testing sets for the models
