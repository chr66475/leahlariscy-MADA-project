{"markdown":{"containsRefs":false,"markdown":"The folders inside this folder should contain all the products of your project.\n\nFor a classical academic project, this will be a peer-reviewed manuscript. \nThe `manuscript` folder contains a template. This template is structured as a report for a class, but you can easily adjust it.\n\nMost manuscripts these days have supplementary material, place those into the `supplement` folder. (You can have the supplement inside the `manuscript` folder or next to it, whatever is better for your setup).\n\nOften, you might make slides for an oral presentation, place those in the `slides` folder. \n\nIf you make a scientific poster, that should go into a `poster` folder. \n\nYou can add further folders. For instance you could have a `website` folder if you plan to write a blog-post or make an interactive shiny-app for your project.  \n\nOften you need a library of references in bibtex format, as well as a CSL style file that determines reference formatting. Since those files might be used by several of the products, I'm placing them in the main products folder.
