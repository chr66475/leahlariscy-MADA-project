Often you want/need references here too. You can use the same reference bib file for this and the main text (as done here) or have separate bib files.\n\nFor illustrative purposes, I'm doing the supplement as pdf. For this to work, you need a (La)TeX system installed. It's easy. Just follow [these steps](https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/pdf-basics.html).\n\nOf course you would choose the format based on needs.\n\nI'm also using a different style for the references here. (vancouver vs apa in the main manuscript). Usually one would have the formatting of the references the same in those two documents, but I want to illustrate how easy it is to switch reference formatting styles, you just need to get the right CSL file and specify it in the YAML header. We could also have a seperate reference bibtext (`.bib`) file, but here we are using the same.\n\n# Overview\n\nA quick overview of what readers can find in the supplement.\n\n\n# Code and file information\n\nExplain here what each code/file is and does, and in which order (if any) users need to run thing to reproduce everything.\nEssentially, give a full set of instructions to re-generate everything.\n\n\n{{< pagebreak >}}\n\n\n# Additional Method Details\n\nOften, the main manuscript only allows for an overview description of the methods. Use the supplement to describe all your methods, models and approaches in a lot of detail. Reference specific parts of your code as needed.\n\n{{< pagebreak >}}\n\n\n# Additional results\n\nShow additional results here. Those can be some useful exploratory/descriptive figures or tables, or results from additional analyses that didn't make it into the main text.\n\n\n## Example additional result\n\n\n@tbl-resulttable1 shows an additional table summarizing a model fit.\n\n```{r}\n#| label: tbl-resulttable1\n#| tbl-cap: \"Another fit table.\"\n#| echo: FALSE\n#resulttable1 = readRDS(here(\"results\",\"resulttable1.rds\"))\n#knitr::kable(resulttable1)\n```\n\n\n\n@fig-result2 shows a scatterplot figure produced by one of the R scripts.\n\n\n```{r}\n#| label: fig-result2\n#| fig-cap: \"Height and weight.\"\n#| echo: FALSE\n#knitr::include_graphics(here(\"results\",\"height_weight.png\"))\n```\n\n\n{{< pagebreak >}}\n\n\n# Discussion\n\nAny additional discussion regarding the supplementary material/findings.\n\nThese papers [@mckay2020; @mckay2020a] are good examples of papers published using a fully reproducible setup similar to the one shown in this template. \n\n{{< pagebreak >}}\n\n\n# References\n\n\n\n"},"formats":{"pdf":{"execute":{"fig-width":5.5,"fig-height":3.5,"fig-format":"pdf","fig-dpi":300,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"knitr"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"pdf","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":true,"merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"pdf-engine":"xelatex","standalone":true,"variables":{"graphics":true,"tables":true},"default-image-extension":"pdf","to":"pdf","toc":false,"number-sections":true,"highlight-style":"github","output-file":"Supplementary_Material.pdf"},"language":{},"metadata":{"block-headings":true,"title":"Supplement to Example Manuscript Template for a Data Analysis Project","subtitle":"","author":"Andreas Handel","date":"`r Sys.Date()`","bibliography":["../../dataanalysis_template_references.bib"],"csl":"../../vancouver.csl"},"extensions":{"book":{}}}}}
