The structure below is one possible setup for a data analysis project (including the course project). For a manuscript, adjust as needed. 
You don't need to have exactly these sections, but the content covering those sections should be addressed.

This uses MS Word as output format. [See here](https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/ms-word.html) for more information. You can switch to other formats, like html or pdf. See [the Quarto documentation](https://quarto.org/) for other formats.

# Summary/Abstract

# Introduction 

## General Background Information
_Infection by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), causing COVID-19, is followed by the shedding of viral particles by multiple excretory functions, including stool and urine production [1,2]._

_Subsequently, these viral particles can be detected in wastewater influent via RNA extraction, followed by Reverse Transcriptase Quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-qPCR) utilizing SARS-CoV-2 specific primers [3]._

_Wastewater-based detection methods have been utilized across the globe as an independent indicator of SARS-CoV-2 viral prevalence and, depending on community-specific factors, as a leading indicator of clinical case trends [4]. WBE methods may also become a primary tool in understanding transmission dynamics as case under reporting increases._


## Description of data and data source
_24-hour composite samples collected twice weekly, stored at 4C until ready for extraction. 6 extraction replicates were performed for each collection date at treatment facility._ 

_2019-nCoV N1 and N2 primer-probe sets were used for universal detection of SARS-CoV-2._

_The concentration per reaction of each gene target was determined by the corresponding standard curve, then sample concentration in copies per liter was determined by Equation 1. Total daily copies per day per WRF was determined by Equation 2._


## Questions/Hypotheses to be addressed
_Is there a relationship between viral load and clinical case observations?_

_Is there a relationship between qPCR percent positive and clinical case observations?_

_What do viral load trends look like over time?_

_What do clinical case trends look like over time?_

_How do each of these temporal trends compare to one another over time?_

To cite other work (important everywhere, but likely happens first in introduction), make sure your references are in the bibtex file specified in the YAML header above (here `dataanalysis_template_references.bib`) and have the right bibtex key. Then you can include like this:

Examples of reproducible research projects can for instance be found in [@mckay2020; @mckay2020a]

# Results

## Exploratory/Descriptive analysis

_Use a combination of text/tables/figures to explore and describe your data. Show the most important descriptive results here. Additional ones should go in the supplement. Even more can be in the R and Quarto files that are part of your project._


@tbl-summarytable shows a summary of the data.

Note the loading of the data providing a **relative** path using the `../../` notation. (Two dots means a folder up). You never want to specify an **absolute** path like `C:\ahandel\myproject\results\` because if you share this with someone, it won't work for them since they don't have that path. You can also use the `here` R package to create paths. See examples of that below.

```{r}
#| label: tbl-summarytable
#| tbl-cap: "Data summary table."
#| echo: FALSE
#resulttable=readRDS("../../results/summarytable.rds")
#knitr::kable(resulttable)
```



## Basic statistical analysis

_To get some further insight into your data, if reasonable you could compute simple statistics (e.g. simple models with 1 predictor) to look for associations between your outcome(s) and each individual predictor variable. Though note that unless you pre-specified the outcome and main exposure, any "p<0.05 means statistical significance" interpretation is not valid._


@fig-result shows a scatterplot figure produced by one of the R scripts.

```{r}
#| label: fig-result
#| fig-cap: "Height and weight stratified by gender."
#| echo: FALSE
#knitr::include_graphics(here("results","height_weight_stratified.png"))
```


## Full analysis

_Use one or several suitable statistical/machine learning methods to analyze your data and to produce meaningful figures, tables, etc. This might again be code that is best placed in one or several separate R scripts that need to be well documented. You want the code to produce figures and data ready for display as tables, and save those. Then you load them here._

Example @tbl-resulttable2 shows a summary of a linear model fit.

```{r}
#| label: tbl-resulttable2
#| tbl-cap: "Linear model fit table."
#| echo: FALSE
#resulttable2 = readRDS(here("results","resulttable2.rds"))
#knitr::kable(resulttable2)
```

# Discussion

## Summary and Interpretation
_Summarize what you did, what you found and what it means._

## Strengths and Limitations
_Discuss what you perceive as strengths and limitations of your analysis._

## Conclusions
_What are the main take-home messages?_

_Include citations in your Rmd file using bibtex, the list of references will automatically be placed at the end_

This paper [@leek2015] discusses types of analyses. 

These papers [@mckay2020; @mckay2020a] are good examples of papers published using a fully reproducible setup similar to the one shown in this template. 

Note that this cited reference will show up at the end of the document, the reference formatting is determined by the CSL file specified in the YAML header. Many more style files for almost any journal [are available](https://www.zotero.org/styles). You also specify the location of your bibtex reference file in the YAML. You can call your reference file anything you like, I just used the generic word `references.bib` but giving it a more descriptive name is probably better.
